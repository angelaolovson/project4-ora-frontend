## Project Choice 
<h2>Time Planner</h2>
<p>I am motivated to work on this project because I have a mobile app that I really enjoy using. However, I would like to make some changes and adapt it to be usable on a computer as well. By doing so, I can enhance the app's functionality and convenience, and make it accessible to a wider audience.</p>
